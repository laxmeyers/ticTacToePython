# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
I created an application to help me know more about game mechanics.
{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}
Thuis is a tic-tac-toe game. The object of the game is to get three in a row horizontal vertical or diagnol. Once you get three in a row you win if no one gets it then it is a tie.
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wrote this to better improve my understanding of game mechanics and frameworks.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
